To set up Ansible, configure it to install Docker and deploy an application within a Docker container, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt-add-repository --yes ppa:ansible/ansible
```

### 2. Install Ansible:

```bash
sudo apt install -y ansible
```

### 3. Verify Ansible Installation:

If you encounter an error related to locale encoding, follow these steps to resolve it:

#### Handling the Error:

1. Open the `/etc/default/locale` file for editing:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/locale
```

2. Update the file to set the locale to UTF-8:

```bash
LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"
```

3. Save the file and exit the editor.

4. Restart your system or log out and log back in to apply the changes.

5. Run the version command again:

```bash
ansible --version
```

### 4. Make Changes in the Ansible Configuration File:

Edit the Ansible configuration file to set `host_key_checking` to `False`.

### 5. Create an Inventory File:

Create an inventory file mentioning the private IP of the worker node, machine name, and private key.

### 6. Create an Ansible Playbook:

Create an Ansible playbook that will install Docker on the worker node and run a nginx container on port 807.

### 7. Running the Ansible Playbook:

Use the following command to run the Ansible playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook your_playbook.yml -i your_inventory_file
```

### 8. Connect to the Public IP of the Worker Node:

After running the playbook successfully, connect to the public IP of the worker node with port 80 on the browser to access the deployed application.
